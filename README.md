# estevez

A personal package of useful functions for crime analysis (and more).

## To do:

- Add corstars function
- Add grouped lm function
- ~Add auto table distribution function~ (~Still need to add cumulative percentages, generate lorenz curves~)
- ~Add mc_gini_test function~ (~Test batch mode~, generate a grid of plots: More complicated than I thought, not really worth it?)
- ~Add index of dispersion test~ (~add batch helper function~)
- Add a test for an observed vs expected chisq test for a count DV (should I?) KS-Test instead (Use the MC_gini_test Replicates)
- Add model deviance function (for glmmADMB objects?)
- ~Add a function for a table of contingency tables, including percentages
  and ratio of observed/expected frequencies~
- Add function to calculate ICC of a three level model.
